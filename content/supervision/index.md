<p style="font-size:20px;text-align: justify;"> 
My research agenda focuses on high-dimensional data analysis problems where the number of features are large in number compared to the number of
data points. I am interested in integrating convex or non-convex penalty functions such as SCAD into some supervised learning algorithms (regression & classification
problems). I also do like borrowing some methodological ideas from industrial engineering and computational ideas from computer science. If you are interested pursuing a graduate study with me, you should already be familiar with generalized linear models (linear regression,
logistic regression), lasso regression, ridge regression, and have very good programming skills.   
I can briefly list the requirements you need to have prior to asking for an appointment from me: </p> 
<p>
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
<li> Previous course work on: Linear algebra, optimization, probability theory, statistics (multiple statistics courses), and machine learning. </li>  
<li> Good level of Python knowledge. </li>
<li> Familiarity with Git/GitHub and LaTeX (and/or Overleaf). </li>
<li> Being a research-oriented person, being able to read and critize research papers published in machine learning venues from a mathematical/statistical/computational view point. </li> 
<li> Strong communication skills (both verbally and orally). </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;color:blue;text-align: justify;"> Thank you very much for your interest. I am not looking for undergrad/grad students for Fall22. I am planning to hire 1-2 grad students to work on developing statistical methodology for high-dimensional data analysis in Spring23.</p><br>

<h1><span color="rgb(132," 132,="" 132);="">Qualifications required for potential graduate/undergraduate students</span></h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align: justify;">Previous course work on: Statistics, machine learning, deep learning, linear algebra, and optimization, good level of Python knowledge, familiarity with Git/GitHub and LaTeX (and/or Overleaf), and being a research-oriented person, being able to read and critize research papers published in machine learning venues from a mathematical/statistical/computational view point, and strong communication skills (both verbally and orally). A lightened version of these rules applies to undergraduate students as well.</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;text-align: justify;">*To graduate students: it is very important to show your prior experience when sending me an email to ask for an appointment. </p>
<p style="font-size:14px;color:blue;text-align: justify;">*Thank you very much for your interest. I am not looking for undergrad/grad students for Fall22.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;text-align: justify;"> 
<ul>
<li> Previous course work on: Linear algebra, optimization, probability theory, statistics (multiple statistics courses), machine learning, data structures and algorithms, database management and big data. </li>  
<li> Good level of Python knowledge. </li>
<li> Familiarity with Git/GitHub and LaTeX (and/or Overleaf). </li>
<li> Being a research-oriented person, being able to read and critize research papers published in machine learning venues from a mathematical/statistical/computational view point. </li> 
<li> Strong communication skills (both verbally and orally). </li>
<li> A lightened version of these rules applies to undergraduate students as well. </li>   
</ul>
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;text-align: justify;">*To graduate students: it is very important to show your prior experience when sending me an email to ask for an appointment. </p>
<p style="font-size:14px;color:blue;text-align: justify;"> Thank you very much for your interest. I am not looking for undergrad/grad students for Fall22. I am planning to hire 1-2 grad students to work on developing statistical methodology for high-dimensional data analysis in Spring23.</p><br>
